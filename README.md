# Python client for PhotoPrism 
A Python client to interact with photoprism.

Changelog can be found in [here](./changelog.md).

## IMPORTANT
This Python client is build on the undocumented API of PhotoPrism. There may be bugs in there. Please let me know if you find some. 

Currently tested on the [version of the 17th of June 2022](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/releases/tag/220617-0402b8d3). It will probably work with later versions. Just try it and let me know, I will update the readme accordingly.  

## Requirements
- requests (latest)

## Setup
To start interacting with Photoprism set up a session. You always need to do this if you start the script. Otherwise there is no session for the client to interact with PhotoPrism.
``` python
from photoprism.Session import Session
pp_session = Session("admin", "changethis", "demo.photoprism.app")
pp_session.create()
```

### HTTPS
It is possible to connect to Photoprism using HTTPS. Two variables exist for this:
- use_https: Boolean
- verify_cert: Boolean

By default, a connection will be made using HTTP. A session can be set up using HTTPS by setting the use_https variable to _True_. By default the certificate will be verified. This check can be disabled by setting the verify_cert variable to _False_. Only change this if you understand what this means. It is better to leave this variable unchanged. 

An example is:
```python
from photoprism.Session import Session
pp_session = Session("admin", "changethis", "demo.photoprism.app", use_https=True, verify_cert=False)
pp_session.create()
```

### User agent
The user agent is _Photoprism Python Client_ by default. You can change this using the variable _user_agent_. 
For example:
```python
from photoprism.Session import Session
pp_session = Session("admin", "changethis", "demo.photoprism.app", user_agent="Hello World! This is an example.")
pp_session.create()
```

## Searching
To search for photos. With this example it will return the first 100 results. You can change this with `count=1000`.

```python
from photoprism.Photo import Photo

p = Photo(pp_session)
p.search(query="original:*")
```
